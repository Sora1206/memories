                    <h2>About her</h2>

                    <p>Sometimes I still wonder how people treat bad to someone like Ryn . She's the kind of person who feels like sunlight — warm, radiant, but never overwhelming.

                         Her face  seems to catch every bit of light, and her eyes... they're this soft amber that somehow hold both strength and gentleness at once.

                          When she smiles, the whole room feels lighter.</p>

                    <h2>About her - 2</h2>

                    <p>But the thing that really gets me isn't just how beautiful she is — it's who she is. Nurin's kind,

                         in this quiet, genuine way that doesn't ask for anything in return. She takes care of people without realizing how much she's doing for them.

                            She'll scold me for skipping meals, fuss over tiny things,

                             but somehow make it all feel natural, never forced.</p>

                <div class="text-content">

                    <h2>her - 3</h2>

                    <p>She's patient, a little stubborn, and surprisingly clumsy when it comes to her own feelings.

                         She pretends to be calm and composed, but I can tell when she's flustered — the way her voice trembles just slightly,

                          or how she avoids my eyes. It's... adorable, honestly.

                            Nurin isn't just beautiful because of how she looks — it's her heart that shines the brightest.</p>

                    <h2>her - 4</h2>

                    <p>She's been through pain, but she still chooses to be kind. She still chooses to smile. And maybe that's why she's pretty— not because of perfection,

                         but because of the light she brings into my life. I love her, no i adore her, she makes my life better than i could ever think of.</p>
